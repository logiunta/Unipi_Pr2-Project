# Unipi_Pr2_Project
It is required to design, implement and document the DataBoard <E extends Data> collection. The collection DataBoard <E extends Data> is a container of generic objects that extend the Data data type. Intuitively, the collection acts as a space for storing and visualizing data which can be of various types but which necessarily implement the display () method. There bulletin board must guarantee data privacy by providing its own sharing management mechanism some data. Each data present in the bulletin board has associated the data category. The owner of the bulletin board he can define his own categories and draw up a list of contacts (friends) who will see the data for each category type. The shared data are visible only for reading: in particular the data can be viewed by friends but edited only by the board owner.
Friends can associate a "like" to the shared content.
